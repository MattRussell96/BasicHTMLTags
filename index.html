    <h3>The Game My Mind Has Been On Lately</h3>
    
    <p>Since I couldn't think of something to make this page about, I figured I would make it about something that has my interest peaked currently!... Besides this class obviously.</p>
    <p>This game is pretty awesome and unlike anything I have played in a long time. You could say for me it is breathing a breath of fresh air into a game genre that I thoroughly enjoy.</p>
